# Inflativa

Inflation is often referred to as the silent killer. This is because people often fail to notice the rise in prices and tend to underestimate the issue. In our project, we will delve into several questions such as:

* What is the projected inflation rate for a specific product in the future based on the product category and city?
* What will be the price or value of a specific product in the future based on the product category and city?
  
We have undertaken this project with the hope that the public will become more familiar with inflation. With this knowledge, we aim for the public to be better prepared to handle inflationary changes. Our project will be deployed on the web using the Python Flask library. Users will be prompted to provide five pieces of information as input: value, product name, product category, user location/city, and the end date for calculation.
